<h1>THE GATHERING OF THE NATIONS.</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is something especially
imposing in the sight of great multitudes; hence, apart from the
bliss, the glory, and the joy which the happy hosts are
represented as possessing in the Apocalyptic vision, there is a
peculiar sublimity in the description given in Revelation vii. 9,
10: &ldquo;After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which
no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people,
and tongues, stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed
with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud
voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the
throne, and unto the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The solitary traveller excites no attention; the ordinary
concourse of even crowded cities soon becomes familiar; but when
large masses of humanity are congregated together for any common
object, it is impossible to be an unconcerned spectator of the
scene.&nbsp; We may have little personal interest in the purpose
that has led them to assemble; we may be perfect strangers to the
mighty host; but by some mysterious law we identify ourselves
with them, and that not only when they are actually present, but
even when they have but an imaginary existence on the graphic
page of descriptive narrative.</p>
<p>These emotions were powerfully excited on the occasion of the
Exhibition in 1851, when such vast numbers visited our metropolis
to inspect the contents of the palace of glass.&nbsp; The
accumulated treasures of art and skill excited the astonishment
of the observer; but it was the countless millions of our
<i>fellow-men</i>, who were continually moving in our midst, that
commanded the wondering observation of the most unreflecting
mind.&nbsp; And now we are called to witness a similar influx
from all parts of our country and the world, to examine another
display of the varieties of international skill.&nbsp; <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Europe,
forgetful for a time of the agitations of political strife, is
pouring forth her thousands who are intent on the encouragement
of those arts which tend to the promotion of peace.&nbsp; Asia is
sending her representatives to inspect those accumulations of
treasure before which the boasted magnificence of Oriental
splendour grows pale.&nbsp; America spares some from her
fratricidal struggle to admire the far more harmless and
honourable competitions of industry.&nbsp; Even Africa and the
inhabitants of the beauteous islands of the vast Pacific have an
interested share in the general gathering; while our colonies
afford, by their contributions, and the number of visitors,
pleasing indications of the rapidity with which they are
following us in the race of civilization.&nbsp; From the sunny
dales, the fertile fields, and the rural villages, as well as
from the busy towns and cities of our own land, our countrymen
are also flocking to share in the peaceful rivalry of the
assembled nations.&nbsp; Who can look with indifference on this
continually increasing aggregate of active, living men?&nbsp;
Imagination cannot but speculate concerning the various emotions
which are throbbing in these countless bosoms; on the different
objects each is pursuing; on the diversified impressions
individuals will receive as they survey our busy streets, our
ever flowing tide of population, our temples of religion, our
government, our virtues, and our sins.&nbsp; Piety, too, will
anxiously inquire, as she surveys the mighty throng, &ldquo;Who
among them feareth the Lord?&nbsp; Whither are all these immortal
spirits tending?&nbsp; What are the stores they are laying up for
eternity?&rdquo;&nbsp; No, we cannot be indifferent to the
scene.&nbsp; We may look unmoved upon the majestic river,
hastening onwards to the sea&mdash;upon the lofty mountain,
towering to the skies&mdash;upon the solid fabric, which the
skill of the architect has so reared that it may defy the attacks
of ages; but it is impossible to behold with apathy the thousands
whose minds are liable, like our own, to the ever shifting
anxieties of life&rsquo;s struggles, whose hearts are subject to
the same conflicting passions with which our own are familiar,
and whose souls are destined to survive the wreck of all material
things in the joys or sorrows of an endless life.&nbsp; Hence,
amid the varied specimens of artistic skill, of splendid luxury,
of earth&rsquo;s products, and of the discoveries of science,
which appear on every side, it is, we contend, the crowding hosts
of the many families and races of mankind which troop along the
aisles of the International Exhibition, which will, to a
thoughtful mind, still present the most serious matter for
interested meditation.&nbsp; Oh, that the scene may awaken those
who profess the religion of the Bible so to display its <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>influence, that
these occasional visitors may carry back with them deep, lasting,
and salutary impressions of &ldquo;the truth as it is in
Jesus,&rdquo; and learn that &ldquo;it is righteousness alone
which exalteth a nation!&rdquo;&nbsp; The opportunity is as
favourable for exhibiting the moral influence of genuine
Christianity as it is unusual.&nbsp; May a powerful conviction of
our national responsibility lead our countrymen to be faithful
and effectual &ldquo;witnesses for God,&rdquo; and not impede the
progress of the world&rsquo;s evangelization by haughty pride,
sordid covetousness, disgraceful profligacy, or atheistic
indifference.&nbsp; Our common faith is on its trial, and
thousands of our fellow-men will be spectators of the issue.</p>
<p>How varied the scenes from which these teeming multitudes have
come!&nbsp; What diversities, arising from birth, residence, and
occupation, mark their separate histories! and, when viewed in
the light of the sacred Scriptures, what solemn thoughts arise in
reference to them all!&nbsp; Some have come from regions where
the false prophet deludes the minds of millions with fatalism and
sensual hopes; others from the wide-spread countries where Popery
corrupts the truth of revelation, burdens the simplicity of the
Gospel with Pharisaic rites, and hides the doctrines of the Cross
behind the crucifix.&nbsp; Some from the dark plains of
heathenism, with its &ldquo;lords many and gods many,&rdquo;
worshipped under hideous forms, where the glory of the
incorruptible God has been changed into &ldquo;an image made like
to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and
creeping things;&rdquo; others from various parts of our own
favoured land, where the Bible is known, and its truths
professedly honoured.&nbsp; But how few, it may be feared, of
this vast multitude, have yielded their hearts to the influence
of the Gospel! how few have realized their real condition as
sinners, their solemn responsibility as accountable beings, and
their need of the atoning blood of Christ!&nbsp; Immersed in the
world, and striving to make the most of their brief sojourn here,
must it not be suspected that they are living for temporal
purposes alone, and that very many are &ldquo;without hope, and
without God in the world&rdquo;?</p>
<p>How painful is such a thought, when viewed in connection with
the rapidity with which the generations of men are passing away
from the face of the earth!</p>
<p>Eleven years since, and a similar gathering, buoyant with hope
and energy, assembled in the Palace of Glass, and wandered amid
the treasures then collected; but what numbers of the busy throng
have now passed into the more impressive realities of eternity!
some to inhabit the &ldquo;house of many mansions;&rdquo; <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>others into
scenes where unavailing remorse is the bitter fruit of
opportunities neglected and privileges slighted!&nbsp; The shadow
of death seems indeed to mingle with the bright colours of
splendour which adorn the present Exhibition.&nbsp; We miss the
familiar countenances of some who took prominent parts in the
gorgeous ceremonial of 1851.&nbsp; Our beloved Queen, whose
presence shed a light and a lustre over the joyous throng, is
absent, for death has entered her palace, and bereaved her of her
Consort, so justly dear.&nbsp; She, in widowed solitude, mourns
his decease; and none who visit this stately building can fail to
miss the lamented Prince, whose comprehensive intellect first
adopted the idea, and defined the principles which regulated the
arrangement of the former and the present Exhibition&mdash;whose
cultivated taste was pervaded by genuine piety, and whose loss
will not soon be forgotten by a grateful and a mourning
nation.&nbsp; He has been called to a nobler, a happier, a
mightier assembly than that of which he was the guiding spirit
here.</p>
<p>The venerable parent of our afflicted monarch, who gained the
gratitude of the people of these realms by the appropriate
training of the present illustrious occupant of the throne, has,
too, become an inhabitant of the silent grave.&nbsp; The aged
Wellington, the hero of a hundred battles, formerly so interested
in the trophies of a peaceful world, has yielded to the mighty
conqueror, Death, and closed his chequered career.&nbsp; These,
with many others known only to the omniscient God, have gone,
leaving mourning hearts and bereaved homes to recall those hours
of happy and enlightened interest they spent eleven years since,
amid the gathering of the nations.&nbsp; They have gone to their
account, and without vainly attempting to scan the varied, the
solemn lot which is now their eternal destiny, let us listen to
the warning voice, which says, &ldquo;It is appointed unto men
once to die, and after that the judgment;&rdquo; and cry,
&ldquo;O Lord, so teach us to number our days, that we may apply
our hearts unto wisdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; They have gone, and we are
yet left; but how earnest should be the inquiry, &ldquo;What
progress are we making in the great purposes of our
existence?&nbsp; What have we done to benefit our race and
promote the glory of our God?&nbsp; Have the powers with which we
have been entrusted been employed for good, or prostituted to
evil?&nbsp; Have we advanced in fitness for that state to which
we are hastening, or have we yielded ourselves more willing
slaves to those sins which degrade, debase, and destroy the
soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The purpose of the present Exhibition is to ascertain what <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>improvements
the various countries have made in the industrial, useful, and
ornamental arts since the first comparison of national
skill.&nbsp; And truly great has been the progress&mdash;humanity
has studied with intense eagerness to multiply the conveniences
and diminish the evils of social life.&nbsp; Luxury has devised
new methods of gratifying the almost sated desires of
self-indulgence.&nbsp; Philanthropy has suggested additional
means of employment for the increasing numbers of the sons of
toil.&nbsp; Science, ever striving to extend the bounds of human
knowledge, has shed its illumination upon many subjects seemingly
wrapped in hopeless mystery.&nbsp; The religion of Jesus, too, we
rejoice to believe, has been making progress during the past
eleven years.&nbsp; Though the obstacles which worldliness,
infidelity, carelessness, and superstition usually throw into the
way have been as great as ever&mdash;though the powers of evil
have not abated in the least degree their accustomed activity,
the Gospel of our salvation has been &ldquo;mighty through
God&rdquo;&mdash;various parts of our own country have been
visited with &ldquo;times of refreshing,&rdquo; and other lands
have received the light of life&mdash;the realms of heathenism
have been pierced, the gloomy regions of idolatry have been
invaded, and in countries where a corrupted form of Christianity
has long prevailed, the Word of God has been set free:
progression has been the character of the times.</p>
<p>These facts afford cause for gratitude, but they also give
intensity to the questions we have proposed.&nbsp; How, then,
reader, has it been with you amid this busy energy, this
universal stir?&nbsp; Have you realized the proper object of your
sojourn here?&nbsp; Have you found your way to the Cross?&nbsp;
Have you advanced in the road which leads to eternal
blessedness?&nbsp; Have you practically felt the solemn truth
contained in our Lord&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Ye must be born
again?&rdquo;&nbsp; Many who at the last Exhibition were living
only for this world, are now ripening for that far nobler
gathering of which they shall hereafter form a part, &ldquo;the
general assembly and church of the first-born which are written
in heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Are you yet a stranger to the blissful
anticipation?##&nbsp; Oh, press home the question, Am I born from
above?&nbsp; Soon will the crowds which now fill the aisles of
this vast edifice be dispersed, to meet again only amid the
realities of eternity; in what circumstances and in what
condition will you rejoin them?&nbsp; In a short time, the
splendours of the International Exhibition will pass away, its
bright colours fade, its unparalleled collection be removed, the
deserted building remain as an illustration of the transitory
character of worldly glory, <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and the labour of years be only a
thing of memory.&nbsp; But when all these accumulated treasures
are scattered, the desire for further progress will still be
active.&nbsp; Still the plotting brain and the industrious hand
will be engaged in devising new combinations of skill; the
restless heart will never cry &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, this panting after some undefinable perfection is the
prominent feature of the age in which we live.&nbsp; Since the
last Exhibition, the vast empire of China has been opened to the
schemes of commercial enterprise, and the efforts of religious
zeal; Turkey has been rescued from the ambitious designs of
Russia; India has been subdued, and restored to prosperity and
peace after the horrors of mutinous anarchy; Italy has made large
advances towards its much-desired unity; but still the
unsatisfied soul of the world is aspiring after a perfection
which is never to be attained by man.&nbsp; The struggle still
continues, and the omens of coming change multiply, while they
assume a more portentous aspect than ever.</p>
<p>America reels with the internecine conflict which rages
between her sons.&nbsp; Rome trembles in the balance of
futurity.&nbsp; Popery grasps with senile obstinacy the last
remnant of her temporal power.&nbsp; France, indeed, maintains
unwonted calmness, but the most sagacious observer is unable to
determine whether it is a prelude to a coming storm, or the happy
subsidence of its oft-excited elements into prospective peace;
and Austria, with her <i>prestige</i> of past splendour, weak yet
despotic, stubborn yet irresolute, strives with anxious
solicitude to preserve her position among the nations.</p>
<p>At home, all classes and all conditions are forsaking the
ancient landmarks, and seeking further advancement.&nbsp; Science
strives by its theories to surpass the discoveries which awakened
the astonishment of past generations.&nbsp; In politics, what
would have been once regarded as the dreams of deluded
imagination, are now esteemed as unquestionable principles of
equity.&nbsp; Even religion has its innovators, who affect
originality, and pretend to be friends of progress by attempting
to revive the discarded ceremonies of effete superstition, or by
disentombing those rash speculations whose utter want of
intellectual or spiritual life had long consigned them to
oblivion.&nbsp; In social life, contentment with the allotments
of Providence is an uncommon sight, and &ldquo;onwards and
upwards&rdquo; is the universal cry.&nbsp; Oh, that this feeling
arose from enlightened principles, and that it were always
directed to appropriate ends!</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Let it
not be supposed that with cynic apathy we denounce the desire of
progress as evil in itself.&nbsp; So far from this, we believe
that it was implanted in the heart of man to stimulate his
efforts, and ultimately secure his welfare.&nbsp; But let us not
forget that gracious Providence by whose blessing only progress
can become a real good, and let us practically recognize the
supreme importance of individual progress in the paths of
religion and virtue.&nbsp; Formed &ldquo;for the glory of God,
and that we should show forth His praise,&rdquo; we are not at
liberty to devote our hearts exclusively or mainly to mere
temporal pursuits.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fashion of this world passeth
away, and the lusts thereof,&rdquo; but the soul must endure for
ever;&mdash;of priceless worth, no Koh-i-noor can compare with it
in value;&mdash;capable of indefinite progression, though
polluted with iniquity, nothing can purify and save it but the
grace and merit of Christ;&mdash;destined to survive when the
earth itself shall be a wreck, it must shine eternally like a gem
in the Redeemer&rsquo;s crown, or sink into never-ending
wretchedness and ruin.&nbsp; Oh, then, reader! neglect not your
deathless soul; be not so dazzled with this passing splendour as
to forget the &ldquo;glory, honour, and immortality&rdquo; which
may yet be yours; while displaying a graceful courtesy to the
foreigners who have honoured us with their presence, do not
impiously slight that blessed Jesus who came from heaven and gave
His heart&rsquo;s blood for your salvation; while honouring the
skilful, the scientific, the industrious minds, the fruits of
whose labours are piled around you, do not dishonour that God in
whom you live, and move, and have your being.&nbsp; Be not so
engrossed with the present as to overlook the future: another
Exhibition is preparing&mdash;another gathering of the nations
will occur&mdash;when, around the glorious white throne,
&ldquo;the dead, small and great, shall stand before God; when
the sea shall give up the dead which are in it, and death and
hell shall deliver up the dead which are in them, and they shall
be judged every man according to his work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here on
earth you are but a unit lost in a crowded world; but in
<i>that</i> assembly, in the sight of the omniscient God, your
individuality shall stand out clearly and distinctly, with its
weight of irremovable responsibility, its noble faculties, and
its liability to eternal ruin or immortal joy: then, deeply
interested in the proceedings of that solemn day, amid the fierce
confusion, the flashing lightning, the rolling thunder, the
falling stars, the awful sounds of angelic trumpets, the songs of
the blessed, the shrieks of the lost, you shall receive that
award <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>from
which there can be no appeal; and even now Time is rapidly
hastening on to bring the final end of all things, and develop
the dread catastrophe.</p>
<p>Your earthly journey, however, may be closed long ere this
event arrives, and death introduce you to that world where your
state will be irrevocably fixed.&nbsp; Give, then, your heart to
Jesus; do it now, and, faithful to His promise, He will receive
you&mdash;His blood shall atone for your sin&mdash;His
intercession secure your acceptance&mdash;His Spirit sanctify
your nature, and, clothing you with the garments of salvation,
more beauteous than were ever fashioned by artistic skill, He
will &ldquo;present you faultless before the presence of His
Father with exceeding joy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, in the heavenly
city, which needs neither sun nor moon, but where the glory of
God sheds its unclouded beams, and the Lamb is the light
thereof&mdash;where nothing enters that defileth, or worketh
abomination, or maketh a lie&mdash;there, in the world&rsquo;s
great assembly, in the &ldquo;building not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens,&rdquo; with the great multitude which no
man can number, who &ldquo;have washed their robes, and made them
white in the blood of the Lamb,&rdquo; shall you join the
triumphant shout, &ldquo;Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord
God Almighty! just and true are thy ways, thou King of
saints!&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
